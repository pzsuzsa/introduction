Hi, 
I'm Zsuzsa Prekub. I am a manual tester, but I would like to write and run automate tests, that's why I'm attending to this course.

 I live with my husband and our 2 cats in Ã‰rd. You can find pics about our 2 cats.
 
 Here's my facebook profile where you can see other infos about me (pics about me, my friends, my husband and my paintings):
