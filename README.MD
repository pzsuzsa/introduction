Hi, 
I'm Zsuzsa Prekub. I am a manual tester, but I would like to write and run automate tests, that's why I'm attending to this course.

 I live with my husband and our 2 cats in Ã‰rd. You can find a pic about me and another one about my 2 cats.
 
 Here's my facebook profile where you can see other infos about me (pics about me, my friends, my husband and my paintings):

 Here you can check what I'm reading now and my favorite books:

I also like hiking, but recently I did not have so much time for it.

I love Balaton, we have a summer house there and spend as many weekends there in summer as we can.
